Rosemary DavyThe code for the Chicago Game is hosted in the same folder that this file is located: /users/rosemarydavy/Documents/Game/It is written in python and can be launched and played on any text editor that is compatible with python (such as IDLE, Visual Studio Code, etc.)The game includes 7 modules (intro, one for each chapter 1-5, and a file titled fullgame.py)Each chapter follows the same formula which makes the coding easy to follow. Each choice the player makes is named by the chapter number and whether the choice is the first or second in that chapter. For example, ch3choice2 is used to call the second choice the player makes in chapter 3 of the game.The functions that include CircleBack in their name are used to keep a logical flow to the game in the event that the player moves back a chapter and chooses a different, non-linear, path moving forward. The CircleBack functions prevent illogical questions from being posed to the player.The program can be run by launching the code via a text editor compatible with Python.Overview of Architecture: intro>ch1choice>ch2choice1>ch2choice2>ch3choice1>ch3choice2.....>ch5choice2To start the game, make sure all 7 modules are downloaded.
